    <h2 id="hello-features">What to Pick?</h2>
    <p>Heroes will be presented as 4 categories: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, or Universal. These attributes are unimportant
        when considering who to pick. Starting out, choose any hero that looks interesting. Click on the hero of choice to go to their 
        hero page, and click DEMO to enter the demo lobby. Here, you're free to test out the abilities and read the descriptions. If you 
        don't like how a hero plays, then click here to change heroes. Once you're comfortable with a hero, enter a solo bot match.
