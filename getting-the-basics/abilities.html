    <p>Abilities will come in 4 forms: active abilities, passive abilities, attack modifiers, and toggleable. 
        Active abilities require players to click the ability to use them, 
        while passive abilities don't require any player input. Attack modifiers add an effect to basic attacks. 
        Lastly, toggleable can be turned on and turned off.</p><br>
    <p>Heroes will have 4 abilities: 3 basic abilities and 1 ultimate. Each hero will have a mix of active, passive, attack modifiers,and toggleable.</p>
    <p>Abilities require skill points to be leveled up. Heroes need to reach certain levels to use points on abilities.</p>
