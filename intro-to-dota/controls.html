    <h1 id="hello" class="section-heading">How to Play</h1>

<p>Dota is mainly played with mouse and keyboard. The mouse lets you be precise in where you are issuing commands, 
    and the keyboard opens up many options for hotkeys. While Dota does have controller support, I do not suggest playing
    or learning on any controller.
</p>
<br>
<p>Every player has their own unique set of keybinds. The only thing that matters is what is most comfortable for each player.
    These sets of keybinds split into different groups:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abilities</li> <!-- QWERDF -->
    <li>Items</li> <!-- TGCVB[space] -->
    <li>Basic Actions</li> <!-- "stop", "attack", "hold" commands -->
    <li>Control groups</li> <!-- 1,2,3,alt-[1,2,3,4,5] -->
    <li>Shop/Courier</li> <!-- open shop, purchase sticky, purchase quick buy, deliver courier, select courier -->
    <li>Communication</li> <!-- team chat, all chat, chat wheel, ping wheel -->
</ul>

<p>I will list the default hotkeys for each group. Based on this, feel free to change to whatever is most comfortable.</p>
<br>

<h2>Default Hotkeys</h2>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p>Ability hotkeys are listed as <b>QWERDF</b>. The first 3, QWE, are the basic abilities, while the 4th, R, will always be the ultimate.
    Some heroes have subabilities, which will take the slot of D and F.
</p>
<!-- include image of hotkey settings and in-game ability icons -->

<h3>Items</h3>
<p>Items are <b>ZXCVBN</b>. Your 6 item slots correspond to these keys in order. If your item has an active,
     then pressing the hotkey will use the active.</p> 
<!-- in-game screenshot of hotkey settings and in-game items -->

<h3>Basic Actions</h3>
<p>There are a few basic actions that is included in the game: <b>attack (A), stop (S), hold (H), and move (M)</b>.
    Using the mouse's right click will autmatically do these based on what is highlighted:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enemy unit - attack enemy</li>
    <li>Ally unit - follow ally</li>
    <li>Ground - move to area</li>
</ul>

<h3>Control Groups</h3>
<p>Dota allows players to summon and control multiple units. By default, these control groups are: <b>123456</b>. 
To set control groups, hold CTRL and press a control group. Dota will save your control groups, so you do not have to 
set them in every game.</p>

<h3>Shop/Courier</h3>
<p><b>F4</b> will open the shop. Then, use the mouse to right click on items to purchase. Left clicking will open the recipe, 
both what components to build the item and what uses the item as a component.</p>
<!-- screenshot of item recipe -->
<br>

<p><b>F5</b> will purchase the first available item in quickbuy.</p>
<p><b>F6</b> will purchase the sticky item. </p>
<p><b>F2</b> will select the courier, which opens up to more courier controls. Pressing <b>F3</b> will have the
     courier deliver your items to you.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p><b>Enter</b> will open the textbox for team chat, and <b>Shift-Enter</b> will open the textbox for all-chat 
    (being  able to talk with enemies)</p>
