    <h1 id="hello" class="section-heading">Lanes and Roles</h1>

    <p>When referring to a lane, look at the map and see what position on the map it is. The top lane is the top most lane, 
        the mid lane is in the middle, and the bot lane is the bottom most lane.</p>
    <p>The side lanes are referred to differently by which side you play, based on what side:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Safe lane refers the lane where the creeps meet the closest to a tower. This is the bottom lane for Radiant, 
            and the top lane for Dire.
        </li>
        <li>Mid lane is the only lane that uses its default name. Both teams refer to the lane as "mid".</li>
        <li>Off lane is the lane where the creeps meet the furthest from a tower, making it easy for enemy to harass. 
            Thi is the top lane for Radiant, and bot lane for Dire.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>There are 5 roles on a team:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carry</li>
        <li>Mid</li>
        <li>Offlaner</li>
        <li>Soft Support</li>
        <li>Hard Support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Carry and Hard Support will go to the Safe Lane. </p> <br>
    <p>Mid will go to the Mid Lane.</p>
    <p>Offlaner and Soft Support will go to the Off Lane.</p>
    <p>*There will be another section explaining each role in more detail</p>
    <p>Each role has different jobs they have to do. </p>
