    <h1 id="hello" class="section-heading">How to Play</h1>

<p>Dota is mainly played with mouse and keyboard. The mouse lets you be precise in where you are issuing commands, 
    and the keyboard opens up many options for hotkeys. While Dota does have controller support, I do not suggest playing
    or learning on any controller.
</p>
<br>
<p>Every player has their own unique set of keybinds. The only thing that matters is what is most comfortable for each player.
    These sets of keybinds split into different groups:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abilities</li> <!-- QWERDF -->
    <li>Items</li> <!-- TGCVB[space] -->
    <li>Basic Actions</li> <!-- "stop", "attack", "hold" commands -->
    <li>Control groups</li> <!-- 1,2,3,alt-[1,2,3,4,5] -->
    <li>Shop/Courier</li> <!-- open shop, purchase sticky, purchase quick buy, deliver courier, select courier -->
    <li>Communication</li> <!-- team chat, all chat, chat wheel, ping wheel -->
</ul>
